# Music Database
Working code for APS105 Lab 9 (Winter 2022). The goal is to create a set of singly linkedlist structs in C to manage a music database library. The database has the ability to insert, delete, search and print songs. This project includes dynamic memory management (garbage collection). See lab handout for more information.
